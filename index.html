    <p>Uruguay, whose official name is República Oriental del Uruguay, is a sovereign country in South America, located in the eastern part of the Southern Cone. Its capital and most populated city is Montevideo. It borders to the northeast with Brazil—state of Río Grande del Sur—, to the west and southwest with Argentina—provinces of Corrientes, Entre Ríos and Buenos Aires, and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (separated by the Río de la Plata)—and has coasts in the Atlantic Ocean to the south. It covers 176,215 km² and is the second smallest country in South America, after Suriname.3 According to data from the latest census of the National Institute of Statistics in 2023, the population of Uruguay is 3,444,263 inhabitants, of which 48% corresponds to men and 52% women,9​ which places it in tenth position among the twelve South American countries.</p>
